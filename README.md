# demo-ama-aks
Demo application to setup aks in azure marketplace

# Description 
Proof of concept to show how manage application offer support to provision containers and Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) resources
- Solution templates: 
The Solution Template offers are not changeable by the publisher after customer deployment. Therefore, containers and Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) resources are not currently allowed in this offer category.
- Managed applications: 
The Managed Application offers allow the publisher to access and control the resources created during deployment in the customerâ€™s subscription. Therefore, containers and Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) resources are provisionally allowed in this offer category.

# Manage Applications can have different approach 
- Via VM offer by executing custom scripts 
- Via deployment scripts 
- Via helm charts
